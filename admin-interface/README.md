# System Visualization
This is a static website that is aimed to visualize the whole system. The website talks to the server, fetching data continously, so that it can in real time display the location of users and cars on the map.

### Running the site
If you have cloned this repo, navigate to this folder locally and run an http server. If you have python 3 this is easily done with:

`python3 -m http.server 5000`

This will startup a simple http server on port 5000.
