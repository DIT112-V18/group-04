## What?
We will create an autonomous vehicle prototype to be used in a car sharing service.
This service will be operated through a phone app.

## Why?
It will hopefully help solve the problem with congestion since our hope is to use these vehicles as public transportation. 
This could potentially reduce the number of vehicles needed as people could in practice use the same vehicle.

## How?
The vehicle will be based on the Smartcar shield platform which can be viewed here.

## Software:
* Android Studio
* Arduino IDE
